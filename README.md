Hi, this is the SSA EPFL TEAM !

We're building a telescope and developping software to detect and catalog satellites and space debris. We simulate their trajectories and predict eventual collisions.


A new way to track satellites

Founded at EPFL in 2020, the Space Situational Awarness (SSA) EPFL Team aims at creating and maintaining a catalog of objects orbiting the Earth in order to prevent collisions with existing satellites and ease space development. Our team had just been created at EPFL and will start operations and recruitment for the upcoming semester. Our medium-term goal is to be able to track and identify most of the objects and debris in orbit that are visible from the ground.


Machine learning

Using a large database of existing satellite images taken from the Earth, the SSA EPFL Team will train a neural network to detect, classify and identify orbiting objects. A catalog containing relevant information about each object will then be made public and continuously updated with every satellite launch or debris detect. This catalog with be made public and accessible by any entity that wish to use it.
