Hi, this is the SSA EPFL TEAM !

We're building a telescope and developping software to detect and catalog satellites and space debris. We simulate their trajectories and predict eventual collisions.


# An optical way to track satellites

Founded at EPFL in 2020, the Space Situational Awarness (SSA) EPFL Team aims at creating and maintaining a catalog of objects orbiting the Earth in order to prevent collisions with existing satellites and ease space development. Our mid-term goal is to track and identify as many objects and  debris in orbit as possible, visible from the ground.

# A challenging sustainability

The problem of space debris is growing exponentially. It has becomes a real and tangible threat to space missions. Since the first launches, space has been considered as an infinite environment, but the reality has set in as collisions have become more and more frequent. A first step in addressing the issue of space debris is knowing where they *are*, and where they’re *going to be* !

# Autonomous telescope

Our goal is to autonomously gather data using our cutting-edge telescope. To achieve this, we work on building a cupola to protect it from the elements, with a first prototype already installed on the roof of the Cubotron at EPFL. We’re also working on integrating a weather station combined with professional meteorological data to optimize observation times. 

In the near future, we will set up the telescope in a remote location to gather the best data possible. This will require an independent energy source and a solid remote connection to send our data.

# Machine learning

Using a large database of existing satellite images taken from the Earth, the SSA EPFL Team will train a neural network to detect, classify and identify orbiting objects. A catalog containing relevant information about each object will then be made public and continuously updated with every satellite launch or debris detect. This catalog with be made public and accessible by any entity that wishes to use it.

# Precision measurements

Using our high quality data, we are developing tools necessary to extract the finest of details. We can therefore measure small variations in luminosity to determine the size, shape and the period of rotation of the object on itself. This allows us to decide whether the object is a space debris or a working satellite !
